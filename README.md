# Expense Tracker

A simple CLI app to record daily expenses.
Features:
- Add and view expenses
- Calculates total amount spent

## Run
```bash
python main.py

### **NEXT STEP**
We’ll now:
1. Add **file persistence** (so expenses aren’t lost after exit).  
2. Introduce **CSV handling with Python’s `csv` module**.  
3. Practice **committing and pushing to GitHub**.  



Once you confirm those two, I’ll show you how to **add CSV saving + loading** — your first real data persistence system (used in almost every backend).
